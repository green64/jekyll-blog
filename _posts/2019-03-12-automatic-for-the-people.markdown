### Blog automation made simple ... maybe

While taking a break from my quest to build the perfect blog, I stumbled on a [personal blog tweet](https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2019/02/introducing-tinnitus-tracker){:target="_blank"} about one man's creative solution to the death of good old concert ticket stubs. Being an avid live music fan myself, I miss the days of reliving my favorite concerts while poring through my beloved stub collection. 

Rob Weychert's site, [Tinnitus Tracker](https://tinnitus.robweychert.com){:target="_blank"} looks cool, and it's built with Jekyll, a "blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites." Maybe this was the solution I'd been seeking! After a lot of experimenting, I'd already decided to ditch re-inventing the wheel -- or in this case blog. Instead, I planned to use a headless CMS or similar solution to create a blog that's somewhat automated, still includes my personal style, and provides blog features like comments and archiving. 

### First, the good news

Installing Jekyll, which is Ruby based, was a great learning experience. I learned about YAML, which uses key-value pairs (like JSON) to create Jekyll front matter. Front matter sounds like brains, and in a way, it is because it defines the page template, whether it has an assigned permalink, timestamps, etc. 

As with creating any blog or app or page in a new framework or language, part of the learning comes in getting the new creation to function correctly online. This experience was no exception. I struggled using Github Pages for the first time, but like the industrious developer I am, I Googled my error that referenced a missing vendor, found a similar Stack Overflow question and answer, and tried that solution. It worked. Voila, my new blog is online. 

### On second thought, is this the best solution?

Jekyll allows you to create pages in markup, which is what I used for this page. Why not HTML? Jekyll gives you that option, but I can't quite figure out what happens to the header and footer when I switch to HTML. That automation is, after all, why I chose this solution. Jekyll has a lot of themes, which I need to explore in more detail. In reading all of that documentation I'll no doubt gain a greater understanding of Jekyll's scaffolding and how the files interact with each other. 

It can be frustrating experimenting with new technologies, and time-consuming too. But it's incredibly rewarding to tackle a project in a completely new format, work through the errors, draw on previous trial-and-error learning, and finally see the fruits of your labor in your browser. Like my [React-Redux experiment](https://murmuring-lake-30920.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [React-Redux-Firebase project](https://protected-earth-36747.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} after that, this may not be my final blog solution. But it's tangible proof of my growth as a developer, and for now, that's enough. 

P.S. I haven't yet integrated this blog with my portfolio, but for now here's a link back to my main site: [samanthamccallfp18.com](https://www.samanthamccallfp18.com){:target="_blank"}. Because the page was created with markup, I didn't think I could open links in new pages without "target=_blank" after my URL. But guess what? There's a version of that code just for markup! Who knew? The learning never stops, amirite?
