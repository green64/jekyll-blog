### Coding class emphasized building the next big app

When I earned my full-stack certificate our instructors wrapped up every group project presentation with mock awards for best use of a SPA, most disruptive app, etc. The categories were designed to push us as developers to try bigger, better solutions, which made sense at the time. But after more than a year of real-life website management, I think the teaching team should’ve also recognized “best minutia management.”

When you think about it, the day-to-day details are important in every aspect of life. There’s no glory in filling potholes, but if roads fall apart nobody goes anywhere. The dishwasher is never summoned to the dining room after a fabulous meal &mdash; diners call for the chef. But without clean plates and utensils, the most amazing four-course dinner ever prepared would never make it off the stove. In the development world, the fastest, most responsive e-commerce website built might seem poised to attract thousands of users. But if that same site is missing a simple SSL certificate, savvy users will steer clear of its shopping cart.

### Day-to-day developing depends more on the small things

As a junior developer, I never believed my first job would require me to build an industry-disrupting app right out of the gate. But as I wrap up year two of adding onto my own site and keeping my company’s website up-to-date, it’s clear to me that attention to detail, creative problem solving, and knowing where to find answers — however insignificant the questions — are invaluable developer skills. I’ve used them to build my own apps and solved more than one work conundrum with my “anti-disruptive” approach.

### You don't need a Fast Company cover story to achieve success

My development work to date isn't going to change lives. But site visitors see a comforting lock next to my URL that tells them it’s a [secure site](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/18/why-an-ssl-certificate-is-important-for-your-company-website/#5dab86211dc3){:target="_blank"}. Their forms are submitted complete thanks to a dropdown menu tweak requiring them to choose a state instead of defaulting to the placeholder value. And they know what to expect when they click buttons and links because I use short words and phrases [written from a UX perspective](https://www.fastcompany.com/3026463/from-google-ventures-5-rules-for-writing-great-interface-copy){:target="_blank"}.

Don’t get me wrong. From my twenty-first century vantage point I understand the [necessity of big ideas](https://www.ted.com/speakers/greta_thunberg){:target="_blank"}. But as a not-so-nascent developer, I also understand the underrated value of thinking small.
